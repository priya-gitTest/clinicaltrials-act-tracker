          <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/make-journals-report-clinical-trials-properly-1.19280">ongoing global public health problem</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The best currently available evidence shows that the results
          of clinical trials are <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114023">routinely withheld</a> from doctors,
          researchers, and patients. This is
          a <a href="http://alltrials.net/">global public health
          scandal</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>How do we contact you?</h2>

        <p>Email
        us! <a href="mailto:hello@ebmdatalab.net">hello@ebmdatalab.net</a>. We're
        always keen to hear feedback, user stories, insights you’ve
        made, errors, omissions, and feature requests.</p>

        <h2>What’s this all about?</h2>

        <p>The <href a="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-110publ85/pdf/PLAW-110publ85.pdf">FDA Amendments Act 2007</a> (“FDAAA”) is a law which says that <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-21/pdf/2016-22129.pdf">certain clinical trials have to report their results, within 12 months of completion</a>. This is really important. Doctors and patients use the results of clinical trials to make informed choices about which medicine works best. But the best currently available evidence shows that trial results are routinely withheld. Previously, laws and guidelines aiming to fix this issue have been widely ignored, despite energetic <a href="http://www.alltrials.net/">campaigns</a>. So we built this website, to increase public accountability, and to help researchers make sure they report all their trials. You can read more about the problem in general, and this website, in our <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/03/12/266452.full.pdf">paper</a> on the project.</p>

        <h2>Who made the FDAAA TrialsTracker?</h2>
        <p>We are the <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/">Evidence Based Medicine DataLab</a> at the University of Oxford, a team of academics, software engineers, and clinicians working together to make live interactive tools as well as academic papers. <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/seb-bacon/">Seb Bacon</a> was the software engineer; <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/nicholas-devito/">Nick DeVito</a> the researcher; <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/ben-goldacre/">Ben Goldacre</a>  devised the project and was PI; <a href="http://bentheillustrator.com/">Ben O’Brien</a> was the illustrator; <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/#team">everyone in the DataLab team</a> contributed. You can read more about our all work - on research integrity, and health informatics more broadly - at <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/">ebmdatalab.net</a></p>

          <h2>Are you publishing a paper on FDAAA compliance?</h2>
        <p>We certainly are, yes. We have a forthcoming paper on reporting rates in compliance with FDAAA; 
           and on the response to this TrialsTracker. You can read about our team's other research outputs on 
            research transparency and clinical informatics at <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net">ebmdatalab.net.</a></p>     
          
        <h2>I’m a nerd! How is this website built, and what assumptions do you make about the data?</h2>

        <p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/03/12/266452.full.pdf">Our paper</a>
          is the best place to read the full
        technical details of how this site was made, how the data is
        processed, how the law operates, and how we translate that
          into code.</p>

        <p>There is <a href="/api/">an API</a>. It's somewhat
        self-explanatory; however, if you would like to use it and

        <h2>What can I do to help make sure sponsors share their results?</h2>
        <p>Trial reporting is a huge, global, ongoing problem. But
        there are more people working towards a solution than ever
        before.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a href="http://alltrials.net">AllTrials.net</a>
          campaign calls for all trials to be reported, and now has
          the support of over 700 professional bodies, patient groups,
          government organisations, industry bodies, research funders,
          and more. Join them, support their work, and encourage your
          organisations to sign up to their simple pledge.</li>

          <li>You can advocate for better trial reporting in your own work community.</li>
          <li>You can use our data to encourage trialists to report their trials.</li>
            <li>You can <a href="https://callyourrep.co/">call your elected representatives</a> and tell them to pressure the FDA to levy fines and publicly censure researchers and sponsors who fail to report their trial results.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>I think some trials on ClinicalTrials.gov are missing from
          your site! Doesn’t the law cover all trials?</h2>
        <p>Sadly, FDAAA 2007 only covers a narrow subgroup of
        trials. We think all trials should report results: you can
        read more about the <a href="http://alltrials.net">AllTrials.net</a> campaign online. On this
        website we only track compliance with the law. We have a range
        of “TrialsTrackers” which monitor reporting for other kinds of
        clinical trial
        at <a href="https://trialsTracker.net">TrialsTracker.net</a></p>


        <h2>What is the difference between an ACT and a pACT?</h2>

        <p>ACT stands for “Applicable Clinical Trial”. These are the
        specific trials required to report results under FDAAA. ACT,
        in the context of this tracker, is specifically referring to
        trials that began after the effective date of the 2016 “Final
        Rule” (January 18, 2017). While the Final Rule created much
        clearer criteria for identifying an ACT, trials that began
        before, and end after, the effective date may be required to
        report, but data on the criteria for judging whether they are
        is less available. These trials are called “probable ACTs”, or
        “pACTS” (by everybody, not just us!) and are identified by a
        different methodology. We have added a tag to every trial so
        you know which methodology was used to identify that
        trial. You can read the details on ACTs and pACTs in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/03/12/266452.full.pdf">our
            paper</a>.</p>

        <p>If you think we have wrongly identified a trial, please <a href="mailto:hello@ebmdatalab.net">get in touch</a>!</p>

        <h2>I found a trial I think is due to report results, under FDAAA, but it’s not listed as due?</h2>
        <p>There are a number of reasons why a trial that completed 12 months ago may not yet be due to report results under FDAAA.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The trial may have become due within the last month:</strong>
            After the trial becomes due, even when the results are submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov, there is a 30 day administrative window to post results. If a trial has submitted results, even if they haven’t been fully posted yet, this should be noted in the study record, and our “webscraping” tool will automatically find that information. However, to be safe, and to account for any updating delays by ClinicalTrials.gov, we wait this entire 30 day period before calling a trial “overdue”. If results show up in the meantime, we will show them as reported. You can read more detail on this in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/03/12/266452.full.pdf">our paper</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The sponsor may have applied for an exemption:</strong>
            Sponsors can apply for a certificate that allows certain trials to delay the posting of results for up to 2 additional years. You can see if this is the case by clicking on the "Results" tab on ClinicalTrials.gov. We might start flagging this on our website too, if it’s useful and interesting for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The trial may not be required to report results under FDAAA:</strong>
            Unfortunately, only a subset of all trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov are required to report results: essentially the law covers trials on drugs and devices: so a trial on a surgical technique, a public health intervention to reduce smoking, or a talking treatment for mental health problems, would likely be exempt. The trials covered by FDAAA are known as “Applicable Clinical Trials” or ACTs. Unhelpfully, although ClinicalTrials.gov know which trials are ACTs, they do not make this information public. We are, however, able to infer whether a trial is an ACT by using other publicly available data. You can read in detail about how we do this, in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/03/12/266452.full.pdf">our paper</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>We may not have updated our data yet:</strong>
              If your trial became due very recently, you may need to wait for a data refresh. We’re planning to refresh the data on this site daily, at first, <a href="/fund/">resources permitting</a>. You can check in the footer of the website to see when we last updated our data, and when the next update is planned.</p>
          </li>

        <h2>I found a journal article/conference abstract/other document containing results from this study. Why are you saying it has unreported results?</h2>
        <p>The FDAAA 2007 is a law that requires all applicable trials to report their results on ClinicalTrials.gov within 12 months of completion. This is to ensure that results are shared in a timely manner without editorial delays; to ensure that results can be easily located; and to ensure that results are completely and correctly reported. FDAAA sets out a standard format for reporting clinical trials. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001566">Previous research has shown</a> that overall journal publications are significantly less complete than structured reports on ClinicalTrials.gov: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4650202/">for example, journals often permit misreporting of prespecified outcomes</a>, and are less complete on safety data. Journal reporting is often interesting and useful but the law requires results to be reported on ClinicalTrials.gov.</p>

        <h2>This trial’s primary completion date has passed, but it has not yet reached its completion date. Why are you saying it is required to report?</h2>
        <p>Under FDAAA trials are required to report within 12 months of their “Primary Completion Date”. The “Completion Date” is a different data field. These data fields have <a href="https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/definitions.html">very specific meanings and definitions on ClinicalTrials.gov</a>. The Primary Completion Date is the last visit of the last subject for measurement of the primary outcomes. Some trials may additionally continue to follow-up with patients for weeks, months, or even years after they finish collecting data on their primary outcomes. The responsible party is required to report the results for the primary outcomes 12 months after the Primary Completion Date. We use the “Completion Date” field to measure when a trial is due to report if the “Primary Completion Date” field is missing. ClinicalTrials.gov allows trial results records to be updated and amended, as needed, to accommodate additional results if and when they become available.</p>

        <h2>How do you calculate what fines a sponsor could receive?</h2>
        <p>The FDA can fine (per 333(f)(3)(B) in table <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-02-03/pdf/2017-02300.pdf">here</a>) non-reporting sponsors up to ${{ FINE_PER_DAY|intcomma }} a day following a 30 day notice period. We calculate the maximum possible fine assuming the sponsor was notified the day after they failed to meet their submission deadline. So each day after 1 year plus 30 days since trial completion without submitted results is another ${{ FINE_PER_DAY|intcomma }}. You can read more on this in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/03/12/266452.full.pdf">our paper</a>.</p>

        <h2>This trial's recruitment status isn't listed as "Completed" and/or the primary completion date is listed as "anticipated" on ClinicalTrials.gov. Why is it due to report?</h2>
        <p>As explained in our paper, any status other than "Withdrawn" (which means no subjects were enrolled before the study was halted) is not considered when deternmining whether a trial is due to report results under the law. Additionally, while sponsors are allowed to use "anticipated" primary completion dates if the actual date is not yet known, it is their repsonsibility to ensure these dates are accurate. The law clearly states that in the absense of an actual primary completion date, the deadline for results will be calculated from the anticipated primary completion date (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/282">US Code 402(j)(3)(E)(i)(I)</a>) 
          
          <h2>What are cancelled result?</h2>    
          <p>When a sponsor has submitted results, but before they have completed quality control with ClinicalTrials.gov, they can choose to cancel their submission. This is noted in the trial record along with any subsequent resubmissions. For the purposes of the FDAAA TrialsTracker, we note these trials in their own "Overdue (cancelled results)" category until new results are resubmitted, but do not calculate any additional fines as it is unclear how these would be assessed.</p>
